#generate 18 hexes and nums and add to list
#add desert tile with roll 7  at end of list
# shuffle list
#populate map with list

#possibly change list to hashmap
#iterate through dict of edges check if it has owner
# if its owned by a player add to point total

#main game class that will be created when game is started
#store game data which later than can be saved and reloaded

#correlate points grid to hex height
#add default sprites marking empty spot
#add code for changi sprite to different icon when clicked
#store points in dict in fomrat (q,r,N/S)
#if N add to coord if S minus??

#use named tuple for coords in dict ??

#function for checking the vertices of a hex

#make functions for accessing verticees and edges of a  hex
#fix json import or coord convert  somethings wrong with coords as they need to be inverted to get correct ones

#turn based game logic
